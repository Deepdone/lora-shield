# LoRaWAN - Architecture

From https://www.lora-alliance.org/What-Is-LoRa/Technology

> **LoRaWANâ„¢** is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) specification intended for wireless
> battery operated Things in regional, national or global network.
> LoRaWAN target key requirements of internet of things such as secure bi-directional communication,
> mobility and localization services. This standard will provide seamless interoperability among
> smart Things without the need of complex local installations and gives back the freedom to the user,
> developer, businesses enabling the roll out of Internet of Things.
>
> LoRaWAN network architecture is typically laid out in a star-of-stars topology in which **gateways**
> are a transparent bridge relaying messages between **end-devices**
> and a central **network server** in the backend.
> Gateways are connected to the network server via standard IP connections while end-devices use
> single-hop wireless communication to one or many gateways.
> All end-point communication is generally bi-directional, but also supports operation such as
> multicast enabling software upgrade over the air or other mass distribution messages
> to reduce the on air communication time.
